There are disabled toilets and parking spaces, but no hearing loops. The cinema has its own car park at the rear of the building.\n\nThe cinema is served by bus stops for the 102, 234, 603 routes, with the 43 and 134 around the corner on Muswell Hill Road. The nearest Tubes are East Finchley, a little over a mile to the west (follow Fortis Green), or Highgate to the south, down Muswell Hill Road."
